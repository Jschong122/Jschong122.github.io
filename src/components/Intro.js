        Iâ€™m a software engineer with experience in building full-stack
        applications using modern technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
        React, and databases. Recently, I developed a medical appointment system
        with a real-time chat interface, using Shadcn UI, NextAuth for
        authentication, and Cloudinary for photo uploads. My focus is on
        creating scalable, impactful applications that streamline processes and
        improve user experience. I thrive on solving complex problems and
        continuously learning new technologies to deliver high-quality
        solutions.
