Growing up\r\n          with two little dogs, I imagined my future working with animals. This\r\n          belief carried me through to my graduation with a degree in animal\r\n          science. However, after finishing my studies, I reignited my passion\r\n          for coding. It wasn't just the rise of AI that drew me back. After the\r\n          failure of opening an online Shopify and WordPress (WooCommerce)\r\n          store, as I couldn't achieve the look and features I wanted, I gave up\r\n          on that idea. This made me rethink my path and ultimately led me to\r\n          put my foot into coding.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <h3>A New Path: Coding</h3>\r\n        <p className=\"font-light\">\r\n          After spending six months in an intensive coding environment, I felt\r\n          incredibly happy when I completed my own project—finally turning my\r\n          ideas into something real. My background in animal science gives me\r\n          strong analytical skills, logical thinking from research, and\r\n          experience working with large datasets—skills I now bring to\r\n          full-stack development. After completing an intensive software\r\n          engineering course at the Institute of Data, I've honed my skills in\r\n          HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and databases.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <h3>Notable Project: Medical Appointment System</h3>\r\n        <p className=\"font-light\">\r\n          One of my proudest projects is a medical appointment system that\r\n          includes a real-time chat feature using Shadcn UI, NextAuth for\r\n          authentication, and Cloudinary for photo uploads. In this project, I\r\n          learned a lot of new tools and started almost everything from scratch.\r\n          I am glad about the result, even though it is not perfect; it is\r\n          undoubtedly an unforgettable experience. This project shows my ability\r\n          to learn quickly and apply modern web development solutions.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>\r\n        <p className=\"font-light\">\r\n          I'm passionate about creating scalable, impactful applications that\r\n          streamline processes and solve real-world problems. By combining my\r\n          analytical mindset with growing software expertise, I’m ready to take\r\n          on new challenges in the IT field and make a meaningful impact.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </main>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\nexport const Head = () => <title>About Me</title>;\r\n\r\n// Step 3: Export your component\r\nexport default AboutPage;\r\n"],"names":["Head","React","AboutPage","className","Link","to"],"sourceRoot":""}
