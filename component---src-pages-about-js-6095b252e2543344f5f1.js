Growing up with two little dogs, I imagined working with animals would be my future. This belief stayed with me through to my graduation with a degree in animal science. However, after completing my studies, I decided to re-ignite my passion for coding. It wasn't just the growing trend of AI that drew me back in, but also the genuine happiness I felt when solving coding challenges and encountering problems that pushed me to think creatively."),n.createElement("p",{className:"mt-5"},"With a unique foundation in animal science, I bring strong analytical skills, logical thinking from scientific research, and the ability to work with large datasets to my current work in full-stack development. Having recently completed an intensive software engineering course at the Institute of Data, I’ve honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and databases. One of my proudest projects is a medical appointment system that implements a real-time chat interface using Shadcn UI, NextAuth for authentication, and Cloudinary for photo uploads. This project demonstrates my ability to learn quickly and implement modern solutions in web development. I'm driven by the goal of creating scalable and impactful applications that streamline processes and solve real-world problems. By combining my analytical mindset with my growing software expertise, I’m eager to take on new challenges in the IT field and make a lasting impact.")))}}]);
